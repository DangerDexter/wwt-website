        The planetarium provides schools and other groups with a great way to
        visualize the panoramic view of the universe provided by WorldWide Telescope.
    </p>
    <p>
        The planetarium described here is just under 12.5 feet in diameter, and just
        over
        9 feet tall. So the first step is finding a suitable location for it! The
        materials used are not suitable for an outside location, so the location should
        be inside, level and dry. Alternative measurements are given for a smaller (9
        feet diameter) planetarium, though all the images
        in this document are for the 12.5 feet model. Measurements are given in inches
        as this is the most used unit for packing materials and particleboard, which are the
        main construction materials used - 48 inch wide corrugated cardboard, and 48
        inch wide particleboard paneling are both easy to come by. The <a href="#TheDomeSpecificationUtility">Dome Specification Utility</a>
        can be used if metric measurements are preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the most interesting features of the dome is that it is tilted at an
        angle of 20 degrees. This makes construction a little more complex, but the
        design gives a much better experience. The idea is that students will feel they
        are traveling in a space ship <em>towards</em> a planet such as Saturn, which
        would not be the case if the view was vertical. The tilt also gives room for a
        reasonable pair of doors, and room for the projector and mirror, without excessive
        height. The cost to this though is that constructing the dome support is as
        involved as constructing the dome (a geodesic half-dome to be precise) itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Costs for materials vary, however a reasonable budget for the dome and
        support components is US $700.00 at 2009 prices. In addition to this a spherical
        mirror is required, optionally a flat secondary mirror, and a suitable projector. Tools are not included in our
        budgeting, as they are common household tools that many teachers and parents
        will own already. A laptop running WorldWide Telescope is obviously not included
        in the budgeting either.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that a number of the tasks involve the use of cutting tools and power
        saws, so responsible adult involvement in the project is essential.

    <p>
        Construction of the dome, and the dome support can largely proceed in
        parallel. To construct the dome support, go through the following procedure:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Purchase the necessary materials:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>5 sheets of particleboard, or plywood, 96 inches by 48 inches.</li>
            <li>17 feet of 2 x 3 inch wood.</li>
            <li>20 feet of 2 x 2 inch wood.</li>
            <li>120 wood screws (1 or 1.25 inch).</li>
            <li>20 heavy duty clips to attach the dome to the support.</li>
            <li>
                10 lengths of 1 x 1.5 inch wood, each piece exactly 48
                inches long.
            </li>
            <li>Two hinges and one handle per door.</li>
            <li>Black 2 inch wide tape.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Assemble the necessary tools:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Miter saw, or compound miter saw.</li>
            <li>Portable circular saw.</li>
            <li>Hand saw.</li>
            <li>Safety goggles and masks.</li>
            <li>Sandpaper.</li>
            <li>Drill.</li>
            <li>Matt black paint.</li>
            <li>Chalk line, or long measuring rulers.</li>
            <li>
                Other tools may be helpful: files, screwdrivers, planes, clamps, saw
                horses, and so on.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Understand the shapes involved. Both the dome and dome support are based on a decagon - 10 sided figure - shown in the following diagram:</li>

                    After tilting 20 degrees the plan view of the support becomes an

                    other panels vary - 48 inches for the rectangular panels. but 47.02 inches
                    and 45.4 inches for the angled panels.

            Cut out, or have cut out for you, the 10 side panels in 0.5 inch

            <li>
                2 at 45 3/8 inch base, with one side at 37 1/4 inches and one at 52
                7/8
                inches.

            <li>1 at 48 inch by 62 1/2 inch rectangle.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Lightly sand and smooth the edges of the wood.</li>
        <li>
            Cut out 20 wooden connecting blocks for the panels, from 2 x 3 (or
            similar) wood.
            Because of the tilt, the blocks are not all exactly the same size. The
            thickness of the wood is not that important - it is
            the angles that are critical. The more accurate you can cut the angles the
            less adjustment will be necessary when the dome support is matched to the
            dome. Most miter saws will not cut at such an acute angle as 17 degrees, so
            first make a template block with a cut at 73 degrees using a miter saw,
            then to cut the 17 degree angle clamp the template block in place,
            carefully place the actual block, and then a 90 degree cut will give the
            desired result. Note that the two cuts on each block need not meet at an
            exact point, though they can. A short flat section between the two angled
            cuts is not a problem. With a simple 10 inch miter saw block widths should
            be chosen that the saw can cut right through - which limits the thickness to
            2.5 inches or so. A compound miter saw will give greater flexibility.<br>
            Before starting on the angled cuts, cut the 2 x 3 wood into 10 inch lengths
            (20 are needed).<table class="T2" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4">

        It is a good idea to take quarter of an inch off the bottom of the doors
        before fitting them, to avoid scraping the floor when opening and closing.
        In this case ensure there is the supporting 2 x 2 wood across the bottom of
        the doorway (to block out the light) shown in the images below.

                    However, to have a 6 foot door the lower side will need to be around 36

                    circular saw to cut out most of the door, but use a hand saw to
                    finish off the cuts. For the rounded door shown in the picture, use
                    a hand held jigsaw to cut out the shape, after carefully drawing the

    <h3><a name="ToConstructaSmallerDomeSupport">To Construct a Smaller Dome Support</a></h3>
    <p>
        To construct a dome support using 36 inch, rather than 48 inch, sides, use
        the following table of measurements for the panel sizes. This will create a dome
        support for a dome that is just over 9 feet in diameter. The dome support will
        have a side to side diameter of 116.5 inches (about 9.5 feet) and a front to
        back diameter of 104.1 inches. Obviously use 36 inch long ledge sections, but the blocks that fit
        the dome support together have exactly the same angles as for the 48 inch sided
        dome support. Note that the door for entry will now be quite short, so consider
        adding 12 inches to the height of all the panels, if your location has the
        headroom!

    <h2>2. <a name="ConstructionoftheDome">Construction of the Dome</a></h2>
    <p>To construct the dome, go through the following procedure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Purchase the necessary materials:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                40 sheets of corrugated cardboard, ideally with one side already white, 48 x
                48 inches. Purchase an extra one or two if mistakes might be made. Alternatively
                slightly fewer sheets are needed with 48 x 96 inch cardboard sheets (as three of
                the smaller triangles can be cut per sheet) but there is a transport issue with
                sheets of this size! So either buy 40 48 x 48 inch sheets, or 15 48 x 96 inch
                sheets, plus a few extra as spares.
            </li>
            <li>
                165 large (2 or more inch wide) paper binder clips. This provides three clips
                per joint.
            </li>
            <li>Black paper sheets totaling 48 inches long by 110 inches wide.</li>
            <li>Matt flat grey (not white) paint.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Acquire the necessary tools:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Sharp knife.</li>
            <li>Long metal edged scale.</li>
            <li>Sharp point, string, and pencil.</li>
            <li>Paint brushes, cleaning materials, newspaper.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            Very carefully draw out and then cut out the template triangles. Two
            sizes of triangle are necessary, labeled as A and B in the following
            diagrams:
        </li>
        <table class="T2" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4">
            <tr>

                    <img alt="" height="528" src="//wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/docs/planetariumimages/Triangle48.jpg" width="581"><br>
                    Use the full width of the 48 inch sheets. <br><br>To draw the triangle
                    you can use a sharp point with a string 48 inches long, and draw two
                    arcs. Where the arcs intersect is the tip of the triangle. Alternatively
                    calculate the height of the triangle (41.57 inches) - measure this along
                    both edges of the cardboard, then draw a line from one side to the
                    other, and mark the center - 24 inches along the line.<br><br>After cutting out the template, 10 triangles
                    of type A are needed.<br><br><span class="style1">
                        Note that the triangle
                        is 48 inches on all sides, and that the flaps are in addition to this.
                        This is possible on a sheet of cardboard only 48 inches wide by having
                        the tapered flaps shown at the corners.

                    After cutting out the template, 30 triangles of type B are needed. This

                    triangles can be cut from the larger sheet.<br><br>13/16ths is a good
                    approximation for .82 inch. The height of the triangle is 34.25 inches.<br>

                        addition to this.

        <li>
            When each triangle is cut out label the outside (not the white side if
            white-sided cardboard is used), with the letters A or B.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mark the lines where the flaps need to be folded with a pencil, then use
            a dull point like a ball-point pen to score the cardboard without cutting
            it to much. Practice on some scraps to gain some expertise first. Score the
            cardboard triangles accurately and fold the flaps out.
        </li>
        <li>
            Double check you have the correct quantities: 10 of triangle A, 30 of
            triangle B, not including the two template triangles (which should be stored
            separately and <em>not</em> painted - in case you need to redo one or more
            triangles).
        </li>
        <li>
            At this stage the inside of the triangles should be painted a flat matt
            latex grey. If white cardboard is used this should not take more than one coat of paint.
            Make sure that the painting is done in a ventilated area, and appropriate
            breathing masks are used. Brown cardboard may take a second coat of paint.
            Although the temptation is to use a pure white paint, this will reflect too
            much of the projection. A flat, light grey should give the best results. It
            is not necessary to paint the flaps completely, but paint over the edges of
            the triangles and into the flap area to ensure good coverage.

        <li>
            After the cardboard is painted it may bow to varying degrees. When the
            paint is dry consider stacking the triangles, perhaps with half facing the
            opposite direction, with a weight carefully placed on top to help counteract
            the bowing effect of the paint.&nbsp; In any case when the flaps are turned out
            this will tend to flatten out the triangles again considerably, so the
            bowing is not the serious issue that it might first look.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Optional step</em>. Make black shades to block out light along the edges of
            the pentagon. There are 55 sides internal to the dome, and 10 sides around the base.
            The 55 internal edges are a mix of 48 and 41.8 inches. Cut out strips of
            black paper long enough that two overlapping pieces will cover the whole
            edge. Obviously shorter pieces can be used for the 41.8 inch sides. The
            internal strips should be 2.25 inches wide (assuming cardboard that is one eighth of an inch wide), with a fold at 1 and 1.25 inches
            along their full length. If the cardboard you have used is not one eighth of an inch wide, then the thickness of the square folds should simply be twice the
            thickness of the cardboard. The folds need to be very straight for the shades
            to fit neatly onto the edges. If a single fold is used the shades will tend
            to keep the binder clips out from the join, which weakens the structure and
            is prone to error. The reason why this step is optional is that to get
            straight folded edges can require paper folding equipment that might not be
            readily available. The images show a folding machine and the completed
            shades. For the external 10 sides around the base, the paper strips should
            be 3 inches wide, folded at 1 and 2 inches along the entire length of the
            strip.

    <p>
        Ideally the viewers inside the planetarium will be seated entirely below the base line of the dome - this is to ensure that no part of them blocks the
        reflection from the mirror onto the dome surface. In practice this may be difficult to achieve, especially if height was an issue during construction. The
        suggested layout is to lay black carpet tiles across most of the floor of the planetarium, with perhaps a few seats set at the back near the projector.
        Shorter viewers sit at the front and middle of the planetarium, on the carpet,
        taller viewers can use the seats at the back. The exact layout depends on the
        number of viewers you plan to accommodate at any one time - all carpeting and no
        seats, or all seats and no carpeting, are obviously options too.

            The projector should provide as high a definition as possible. Ideally the

            a 16 x 9 aspect ratio). Such a projector will require a DVI or HDMI cable
        </li>
        to connect to the laptop. DVI is recommended as there is no use for the

            can be used to provide some fine adjustment should it be necessary or helpful. In the image below a second tier keyboard support (for a music keyboard)
            has been cut and drilled to provide a mirror support that can both take a variable size of mirror, and have the angle of the mirror finely adjusted.

            The projector needs to be placed pointing up at the mirror so that the image
            is reflected off the mirror to fill the dome, but not the dome support. For this
            a solid support system is needed that will safely hold the projector at an angle
            of about 20 degrees, and provide fine turning adjustment. One good solution to this
            is to use a solid music or conductors stand (as shown in the image below). These
            can be found reasonably cheaply (around $50) and are surprisingly sturdy. Find
            one that enables adjustment in both side to side, and up and down directions,
            and is variable in height from around 24 to 40 inches.

            An alternative to the primary projection described in step 4, is to use a secondary mirror. Use of a secondary mirror has the advantage that the
            projector and support are no longer near the center of the dome using up valuable spectator space. However the downside to using a secondary mirror is
            that it involves additional cost (of the secondary mirror itself, and some
            shelving), and complicates the alignment - the projector, secondary mirror, and spherical
            mirror now all have to be aligned simultaneously and correctly.

                    To use the secondary mirror method of projection, first install a

                    though this does obviously depend on the size of the projector you

    <p>
        Most mirrors reflect light from two surfaces, the inside and outside faces of
        the glass or plastic. Unfortunately this means that there will be two images in
        view on the dome for each single object in the simulated sky - the intended
        image and a second fainter image slightly offset from the first. This problem is doubled if a secondary mirror also with two reflective surfaces is used - in this case there will now be four images on the dome, the intended one and three fainter ghost images. This problem can be eliminated with the use
        of high quality first surface mirrors. These mirrors, both flat and spherical, have only one reflective surface, so even when a secondary mirror is used no unwanted ghost images
        appear on the dome. Of course the issue here is cost, first surface mirrors are a few times more expensive than normal mirrors.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of first surface mirrors is recommended if your
        budget allows!

                    then the aspect ratio may well be 4:3, so set this value to <strong>Mirrordome 4:3.</strong> Refer to the <b>Configuration</b> section of the

                    contains the center of interest in vertical degrees. <br><br>For

            If you wish to control the presentation by looking at the laptop, then you are good to go
            - the mouse movements and clicks on the laptop screen control the view. If you wish to control the presentation by looking at the
            dome projection, then select <b>Detach Main View to Second Monitor</b>. Consider using an XBox controller in this latter case,
            as input control has now be passed to the dome view and controlling the
            presentation with a mouse can be awkward.
